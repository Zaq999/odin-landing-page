# Odin landing page

## ABOUT:
Another project from The Odin Project.
The goal was to create a landing page from a given template to practice CSS especially Flex to display all elements.
Someday I will return to this project to add responsivnes because my landing page looked different on different monitors 
and it annoyed me a bit.
